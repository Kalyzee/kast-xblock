# KAST (your Mooc)
  
  
# What is it?

The Kast xblock is a powerfull and easy to use module for your OpenedX architecture. It allows professors to  record their webcam and PDF directly from the studio.
You want to reinvent way to create and consume your Mooc video? Sure you will love our xblock. Students will have not one but two sections, one with professor's cam and one with PDF. The PDF is automatically synchronized but students can choose to change the current page of PDF and go back or forward.
This new way to present courses will transform your courses and help you to be more innovative !

# Documentation

# Story

With the second prize for their Knotes module in the first french OpenedX Hackathon, the Kalyzee team wanted their revenge at the regular OpenedX Hackathon in Boston. Came with the project to improve their first project, they decided to switch on an awesome and crazy project in the last minutes : creating a video directly from OpenedX Studio.
A really big idea (and challenge) that activated the Xtrem Programming mode of these crazy developpers !
Thirsty of efficient coding lines, they have done their best to produce this amazing module, and change the way we perceive what is a Mooc !
